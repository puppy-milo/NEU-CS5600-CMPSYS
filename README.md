# NEU-CS5600-CMPSYS
A crucial component of the course is the lab assignments. Five labs covering Setup and tools, C review, Shell, Virtual Mem, and File System.
## [Labs overview](https://naizhengtan.github.io/22spring/labs/)
### [Lab0:Setup and tools](https://naizhengtan.github.io/22spring/labtutorials/lab0/)
This lab will let you heavily use gcc that is a widely used compiler, make, and gdb. 
+ See a quick introduction of gcc [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/99wi/Section/gccintro.html).
+ Make is a system to organize compilation. When you run make, the compilation system will look for a file named Makefile and executes the rules within. Here is a [quick introduction](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/).
+ GDB is the GNU Debugger, a tool that every programmer should know how to use. Let see [tutorial](http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html).
### [Lab1:C review](https://naizhengtan.github.io/22spring/labtutorials/lab1/)
This lab will give you practice in the C programming language. For those who know C, this will reinforce your prior experience; for others, this is a good opportunity for you to learn C. The overall comfort you’ll gain (or reinforce) with C language and the Linux computing environment will be helpful for future labs.

Lab1 has three main sections:

    + Implementing a simple cipher.
    + Implementing a linked queue.
    + Implementing a ciphered queue using the cipher and the queue.
### [Lab2:Shell](https://naizhengtan.github.io/22spring/labtutorials/lab2/)
In this lab, you will learn how a shell is built. You will improve (or reinforce) your shell-using skills. You will also gain experience with C programming (you will interact with critical constructs, such as pointers and data structures, as well as standard idioms like linked lists). Along the way, you will use the fork(), a system call that we’ve intensively discussed in lectures.
